====================

Homework 6 is focused on the topics included in the Linear Models module for p8105.

Problem 1
=========

The next problem explores data gathered by the Washington Post on homicides in 50 large US cities.

### Load and Clean the Data

Data was read in from a CSV posted on GitHub.

``` r
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"
homicide_data = read_csv(url, na = "Unknown") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Data cleaning steps were subsequently followed:

``` r
clean_homicide_data = homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         resolved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state == "Dallas, TX" | city_state == "Phoenix, AZ" | city_state == "Kansas City, MO" | city_state == "Tulsa, AL"))
```

Cleaning steps:

-   Created a `city_state` variable combining city and state.
-   Created a binary variable `resolved` indicating if crime was solved. "1" signifies solved ("Closed by arrest"), and "0" signifies unsolved "Closed without arrest" or "Open/No arrest".
-   Modified `victim_race` to have categories "white" and "non-white", with "white" as the reference category.
-   Converted `victim_age` to numeric.
-   Filtered out Dallas, TX, Phoenix, AZ and Kansas City, MO (incomplete data for variables of interest), and Tulsa, AL (data entry error).

### Fitting logistic regression model

``` r
fit_logistic = clean_homicide_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  select(victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, resolved) %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) 

fit_logistic %>% 
broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                  |  estimate|  std.error|  statistic|  p.value|     OR|
|:----------------------|---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|------:|
| (Intercept)           |     1.186|      0.235|      5.055|    0.000|  3.274|
| victim\_age           |    -0.007|      0.003|     -2.142|    0.032|  0.993|
| victim\_sexMale       |    -0.888|      0.136|     -6.525|    0.000|  0.412|
| victim\_racenon-white |    -0.820|      0.175|     -4.694|    0.000|  0.441|
