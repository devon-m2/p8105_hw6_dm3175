Homework 6 Solutions
====================

Homework 6 is focused on the topics included in the Linear Models module for p8105.

Problem 1
=========

The next problem explores data gathered by the Washington Post on homicides in 50 large US cities.

### Load and Clean the Data

Data was read in from a CSV posted on GitHub.

``` r
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"
homicide_data = read_csv(url, na = "Unknown") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Data cleaning steps were subsequently followed:

``` r
clean_homicide_data = homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
         resolved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state == "Dallas, TX" | city_state == "Phoenix, AZ" | city_state == "Kansas City, MO" | city_state == "Tulsa, AL"))
```

Cleaning steps:

-   Created a `city_state` variable combining city and state.
-   Created a binary variable `resolved` indicating if crime was solved. "1" signifies solved ("Closed by arrest"), and "0" signifies unsolved "Closed without arrest" or "Open/No arrest".
-   Modified `victim_race` to have categories "white" and "non-white", with "white" as the reference category.
-   Converted `victim_age` to numeric.
-   Filtered out Dallas, TX, Phoenix, AZ and Kansas City, MO (incomplete data for variables of interest), and Tulsa, AL (data entry error).

### Fitting logistic regression model for Baltimore, MD

Focusing on homicide data from Baltimore, MD, a logistic regression model was fitted using `glm` function with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors.

``` r
# fit logistic regression model on baltimore data
fit_logistic_balt = clean_homicide_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  select(victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, resolved) %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) 

# tidy output for adjusted OR and confidence interval for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all other variables fixed
fit_logistic_balt %>% 
broom::tidy() %>% 
  cbind(exp(confint(fit_logistic_balt))) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-white") %>% 
  rename("conf_2.5" = "2.5 %", "conf_97.5" = "97.5 %") %>% 
  select(term, OR, conf_2.5, conf_97.5) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

    ## Waiting for profiling to be done...

| term                  |     OR|  conf\_2.5|  conf\_97.5|
|:----------------------|------:|----------:|-----------:|
| victim\_racenon-white |  0.441|      0.312|        0.62|

**Interpretation**: The table output represents the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all other variables fixed. The resulting odds ratio is less than 1, which indicates that the odds for having a homicide resolved in the non-white race victim group is lower than among whites. The results from this logistic regression model may therefore suggest that disparities exist in how likely a crime is to be resolved depending on the victims' race.

### Fitting logistic regression model for all cities

Removed crimes where the victim sex was unknown

``` r
# fitted logistic regression model by city_state
nest_fit_logistic_all = clean_homicide_data %>% 
  filter(!(victim_race == "NA" | victim_sex == "NA")) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())),
         confid = map(models, broom::confint_tidy),
         models = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  unnest()
  
# tidied the dataframe, including adding OR and CI estimate

nest_fit_logistic_all %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         conf.low = exp(conf.low),
         conf.high = exp(conf.high), 
         log_OR = estimate) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-white") %>%
  select(city_state, term, OR, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 47 x 5
    ##    city_state      term                    OR conf.low conf.high
    ##    <chr>           <chr>                <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>

    ##  2 Atlanta, GA     victim_racenon-white 0.753   0.424      1.30 
    ##  3 Baltimore, MD   victim_racenon-white 0.441   0.312      0.620

    ##  5 Birmingham, AL  victim_racenon-white 1.04    0.612      1.75 
    ##  6 Boston, MA      victim_racenon-white 0.127   0.0472     0.285
